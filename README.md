Built as part of the Bob Ziroll's [Learn React for free](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) Scrimba course.

I have also implemented a few additional features: 
- Looks good on Mobile Screens or On Desktop Screens
- Added a Loosing Keyboard Fall Apart Animation
- Added a timer, which pauses in case of Win Or Loose, and timer running out is another loss condition.
- Words are now being fetched from an online website, thus expanding the functionality. [Link](https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/word?lang=en&length=${randomLength})
- Words fetched randomly vary from length 5-14.
